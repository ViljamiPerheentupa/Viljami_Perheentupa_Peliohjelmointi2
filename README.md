Unity Version 5.2.1

To start the game: Click on the Start Game button. If the mouse cursor isn't visible, press Shift-F1 in the editor.
In-Game: Use WASD to move and the Arrow Keys to shoot. If you have a controller, Right-Stick to move and Left-Stick to shoot.

You have only one life. Die, and the game ends. Score is not saved, for I could not be bothered.


I did everything in the tutorials, including video 23
Meaning I added:
- Particles when hitting an enemy
- Explosion effect when killing an enemy
- Sound effects to the weapon shooting and hitting something

All sound effects were made by me in Audacity with a microphone and a bit of time. They're fantastic.
I also added sounds to the player getting hit and dying, as well as when the player kills an enemy. Most sounds have multiple different variations, and they're played by randomly selecting one from an array variable inside the respective blueprints
To make the player getting hit sound a bit less annoying, I added a simple Do Once with a Delay of 1 second before the sound could be played again.
